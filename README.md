# Remix IDE Blank Template

Welcome to your new **Remix IDE Blank Workspace**!

This workspace has been generated using the "Blank Template" option in Remix IDE. It starts with only minimal configuration files, giving you full control to build your project from scratch.

---

## What's Included?

- **`remix.config.json`**: Default Remix IDE workspace configuration.
- **`.prettierrc.json`**: Basic Prettier formatting rules for code consistency.

No contract files, folders, or sample code are included.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Create Files & Folders**

   - Add new Solidity files, scripts, or folders as needed for your project.
   - You can organize your workspace structure in any way you like.

2. **Setup Project Settings** (Optional)

   - Modify `remix.config.json` or add additional configuration files as your project grows.

3. **Write & Compile Smart Contracts**

   - Use the **Solidity Compiler** and **Deploy & Run Transactions** plugins (available in Remix IDE's left sidebar) to develop and test your contracts.

4. **(Optional) Initialize Git**

   - If you checked "Initialize as a Git repository" during workspace creation, you can start committing your code immediately.
